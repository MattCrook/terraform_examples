Be sure to replace INSERT_USERNAME with your username and then run terraform plan and verify the output looks correct.
If it does, run terraform apply to apply the changes.

Run terraform apply followed by terraform output ip to return the instance's external IP address. 
Validate that everything is set up correctly at this point by connecting to that IP address with SSH.

This tutorial needs the default network's default-allow-ssh firewall rule to be in place before you can use SSH to connect to the instance. 
If you are starting with a new project, this can take a few minutes. 
You can check the firewall rules list to make sure that the firewall rule has been created.

Run this to ssh into the newly created VM:
ssh `terraform output ip`

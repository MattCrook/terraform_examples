Set DB password in a Secrets manager or on the command line.
If set on the command line, use the variable "db_password" {}
and set the env variable like: $ export TF_VAR_db_password="(YOUR_DB_PASSWORD)"
Note - the space at the beginning before export - to prevent the secret from being stored on disk in bash history.
